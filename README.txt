Beanstalkd is a Drupal module to allow Drupal Queues to take advantage of beanstalkd to process the queues instead of the built in Database queue system that ships with Drupal.

What is Beanstalkd
------------------

Beanstalk is a simple, fast workqueue service. Its interface is generic, but was originally designed for reducing the latency of page views in high-volume web applications by running time-consuming tasks asynchronously.
